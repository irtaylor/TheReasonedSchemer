# Logical Laws

## The Law of Fresh

If `x` is fresh, then `(v x)` succeeds, and associates `x` with `v`.

## The Law of -

`(v w)` is the same as `(w v)`.

## The Law of conde

To get more values from conde, pretend that the successful conde line has failed,
refreshing all variables that got an association from that line.
